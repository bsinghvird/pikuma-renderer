A basic renderer made with C and SDL. As no graphics API was used, nearly all aspects of the renderer were made manually, including all the functions needed to implement the 3D math to properly manipulate points in a 3D space and display them onto the screen.
The SDL library was used simply for the actual "drawing" of the pixels on the screen. 

This renderer was made following along with Pikuma's "3D Graphics Programming from Scratch" course.
